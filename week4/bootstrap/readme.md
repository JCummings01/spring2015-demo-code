# Boostrap 101

## What is Bootstrap?

1. http://getbootstrap.com/
1. Front-end framework - providing a number of helpful utility classes to quickly create and style a site
1. [Download](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download) - either a CDN via `yo refactoru-html`
1. Example - 01_quickstart

## Grid

1. 12 columns, unlimited rows (think graph paper!)
1. Grid size is mobile first - xs, sm, md, lg
1. Grid classes work from mobile up, all grid classes will stack until the breakpoint is reached.
    - If you use `.col-md-4` - your grid will stay stacked on devices smaller than medium. On a medium device it will go horizonal.
